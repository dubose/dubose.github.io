										<h2>A Note On My Work Experience</h2>
									</header>-->
<!-- What I want to say in this paragraph is something about employers not being concerned over my work experience. I have performed well in the positions I have held, and I have had the opportunity to learn a lot of work-related things through classes and projects of mine - specifically 227 and my speakers, both of which were not dissimilar from being an employee. I am a fast learner (learned nearly everything to build my speakers as I was building them) and hard worker and am up to the challenge of dealing with a learning curve wherever I end up working.-->
									<p>My work history has given me opportunity to attain and exhibit 
									many of the qualities that mark a productive and desirable employee of any company.  
									First and foremost, I am a <b>hard worker</b> and do 
									not shy away from uncomfortable tasks, as seen in my record with Harvard Dorm Crew and Georgia 
									Civil. Nor am I 
									uncomfortable when <b>responsible for others</b>, as I have shown by my work with Harvard Summer 
									School. I am a <b>fast learner</b> and am <b>not intimidated by the challenge of a learning curve</b>; my audio system 
									project (on my Engineering page) was built from scratch in four months.  
									My quantitative abilities complement my ability to 
									work well in groups, speak thoughtfully, think critically, and present ideas well.</p>

												<h3>Harvard Summer School</h3>
											</header>
											<p>During the summers of 2015 and 2016 I worked with the Harvard Summer School, serving as 
											proctor during both summers and as an Assistant Coordinator in one of the administrative 
											offices in 2015. My proctor role involved monitoring 30 high school students living in my hall, 
											being in frequent communication with my Assistant Dean, planning weekly social events for my 
											students, diffusing conflicts that arose, completing mid-summer checkups with each student,  
											and assisting in organizing events throughout the summer. When I was Assistant Coordinator, 
											I was responsible for the 25+ trips into the Boston area put on by our office. I finalized 
											logistics, ensured we had tickets, trained trip chaperones, communicated with venue administrators, 
											planned travel, and oversaw most trip departures.</p>

												<h3>Harvard Dorm Crew</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Dorm Crew is a student-run group responsible for preparing dorms for summer school after the end of the 
											spring semester (called Spring Clean Up - SCU) and then preparing them for the fall semester after summer 
											school ends (Fall Clean Up - FCU). I participated in FCU my freshman fall, then SCU for the 
											subsequent three springs. These programs involve working 8 a.m. to 4:45 p.m. in a crew of 10-20 and 
											cleaning an entire dorm building (ranging from 20 to 120 rooms) in one week. The students who 
											run Dorm Crew are called Captains, and each Captain is in charge of a crew.
											In spring of 2016, I was requested to work with numerous Captains and was the most requested worker among 
											the 200+ students in SCU, indicative of my hard work in previous SCU/FCUs.</p>

												<h3>Harvard Athletics - Term Time</h3>

											<p>I worked term-time during my sophomore year as a desk monitor for Harvard Athletic Department in 
											one of our campus gyms. My responsibilities included checking in members and their guests, fielding 
											phone calls about resource reservations, and managing conflicts over court or room space when 
											they arose.</p>

												<h3>Georgia Civil</h3>

											<p>During the summer after my freshman year of college I interned at Georgia Civil, a civil 
											engineering firm in Madison, GA. I assisted frequently with land surveying, traveling to numerous work sites 
											across Georgia and using both total stations and GPS methods. In the office, I searched databases 
											for potential building plots for clients of ours, conducted building code research to advise 
											a particular client case, and assisted with administrative tasks when needed.</p>

												<h3>Benchmark Automation</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Benchmark Automation is a food packaging automation manufacturer in Athens, GA, and I 
											interned with them during a summer in high school. While it was part-time, it gave me insight 
											into manufacturing, the types of tools and precision needed to create such large 
											instruments, the myriad ways a computer can detect and manipulate an object on a conveyer 
											belt, and the ingenuity needed to create novel and custom solutions to clients' problems. 
											I worked as an assembly intern, assisting with assembly of the machines and seeing many 
											different sides of the assembly process over the course of the summer.</p>
